# Description

Python project developed with PyGame: a side-scrolling mobile game inspired by Flappy Bird, where the player pilots a plane filled with passengers eager for vacation. Obstacles in the form of mountain ranges must be avoided through precise maneuvers, performed via clicks or screen taps. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score, providing an engaging, challenging, and accessible experience for users.
